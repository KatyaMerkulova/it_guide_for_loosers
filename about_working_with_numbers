1. to reduse the number of iterations in the "for" you can divide the input value by the interval between numbers 
for example, take every third:
nn = 10
for n in range(1, nn//3 + 1):
  ...

for example, take every second:
for n in range(1, nn//2 + 1):
  ...
  
2. the range() function has three input arguments start - the number from which cycle starts, stop and step
range(start, stop, step)

3. additional features of the print() function:
print(a) = print(a,end='\n') by default
print(a,end=' ')

3. float numbers
4.5 = 45 * 10^-1 = 45e-1 where 45 - mantissa and -1 is the exponent
computer accuracy = E = 1e-15
numbers greater than or less E the computer doesnt understand((

4. work with math functions
import math
.
.
.
math.e, math.sqrt, ...
